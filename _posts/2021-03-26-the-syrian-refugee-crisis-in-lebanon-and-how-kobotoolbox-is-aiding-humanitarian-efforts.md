**Despite shifting global attention toward the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020
and 2021, the war devastating Syria and its people** [**drags
on**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53322857)**. The lives of
millions of Syrians fleeing for safety continues to be precarious and their
futures uncertain.**

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
[UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/), is leading humanitarian efforts for refugees
within Lebanon — Syria's neighbour who the continued crisis has particularly
hard hit. The Government of Lebanon estimates that they are hosting roughly [1.5
million](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/68651) Syrian refugees who
have fled since the war outbreak in 2011, putting significant strain on the
country, its people and its resources. Only about 870,000 refugees of the total
estimated amount [are
registered](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/71) with the
UNHCR.

To better understand Lebanon's refugee crisis, a collaborative effort by the
UNHCR, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme
(WFP) developed [VASyR](http://ialebanon.unhcr.org/vasyr/#/), the Vulnerability
Assessment of Syrian Refugees. The report aims to reveal a cross-section of the
refugee population in annual snapshots — allowing for invaluable insights into
the lives of thousands of families over time as the crisis continues. VASyR uses
the [KoBoToolbox suite of tools](https://kobotoolbox.org) for all its data
collection efforts across Lebanon.

The 2020  report's [most recent
findings](http://ialebanon.unhcr.org/vasyr/files/vasyr_2020/VASyR%202020.pdf)
show a devastating picture of life as a refugee in Lebanon, made even more
challenging throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial insecurity is on the rise as 92% of refugee families are in debt, and
9 out of every ten households live in extreme poverty conditions — a 34%
increase from 2019. There is a significant gender disparity as woman-headed
households have significantly lower income than men-headed ones — 86% of women
were outside the labour force and 25% of men were unemployed. Children are
scarcely able to attend school due to the high costs of transportation and
learning materials —  or not at all due to the current pandemic. Often they are
drawn out of school into oppressive child labour conditions, and young girls
married off. Only 20% of those aged 15 and older are legal residents. Most live
in conditions below basic humanitarian standards, and access to clean water and
sanitation is scarce.

The report's annual findings allow humanitarian organizations and local
governments to focus their efforts, funding, and resources to where it's most
needed.

The data collection is from a sample of some 5,000 refugee families in 26
districts across Lebanon, and [each
survey](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/84558) consists of around
580 questions with translations in both English and Arabic. The surveys are
constructed using the [XLSForm](https://xlsform.org/en/) open standards and
contain complex logic that asks a range of contextually appropriate questions
and guides enumerators through the interview.

In total, 70 enumerators from various organizations who have partnered with the
UNHCR move from family to family in teams of two for several weeks. Each
registered household has a unique case number and a barcode that is scanned into
the form to identify and monitor the family's case over time.

Once the collection process is complete, data validation, cleaning and
preliminary analysis take place over three months using a range of external
tools, after which the report can be compiled.

With few teams on the ground, limited time and harsh conditions, efficient and
robust means of collecting and managing data are critical.

> "The operation decided to use KoBoToolbox mainly since it is a free open-source
tool for data collection, works offline, easy to create forms and users on the
server, and is used by most of the humanitarian actors. Hence, data collectors
require minimum training to configure and use the forms. In addition to that,
forms are easily integrated into other systems for monitoring and for creating
dashboards." —  Raffi Kouzoudjian, UNHCR

The UNHCR has been working with KoBoToolbox since 2016 to ensure that their
humanitarian efforts on the ground are more streamlined and impactful.
